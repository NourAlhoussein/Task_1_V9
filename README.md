# My JavaScript Project

## Description

This project is a Library Mangement System;

i have Library class and Book class and ReferenceBook class,

1-Inheritance:We applied inheritance to this class, so it inherits the Book class and added locationCode to it.

2-Encapsulation:This is done by applying the # property to the parameters.

3-Polymorphism:We implemented the polymorphism feature when we used the displayInfo() function in the book class in referencesClass, but we added the locationCode to it, meaning we used the function in more than one form.

4-Abstraction:We have hidden the internal details and can only be accessed through specific functions such as get title().

## Features

- List books
- Filter by category
- search by title or author
- Add new books

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the UI to interact with the library system.
